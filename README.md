# esp32_ws2812

control a ws2812-lightstrip with an esp32. It works with the RMT driver, designed for remote control interfaces.
Because it has to parallel with a web server it was necessary to set up some special settings.

## hardware 

There's a 74HCT14 as an interface between the 3,3 V esp32 interface and the led strip 5v data input.
A resistor of 470 ohm is recommended in the data line.
A capacitor of 1000 ÂµF is used for stabilisation of the power supply.

## software

The software basedd on the official ESP-IDF SDK. Pleas follow the instruction on [get started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html)

A REST service is used for controlling the displayed scenes. The interface uses JSON data for config and define scenes.

To bring the wifi interface up the esptouch framework version 1 is used, you need the esptouch app on a smartphone.
